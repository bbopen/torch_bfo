A PyTorch implementation of the Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm.

## Installation

You can install `bfo-torch` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install bfo-torch
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the `BFO` optimizer with a PyTorch model:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from bfo_torch import BFO

# Define model and data
model = nn.Linear(10, 1).cuda()
optimizer = BFO(model.parameters(), population_size=50)

# Define closure for BFO
def closure():
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(data)
    loss = criterion(output, target)
    return loss.item()

# Optimization step
optimizer.step(closure)
```

The optimizer ships with aggressive defaults tuned from convergence analysis.
`step_size_max` is enlarged to `1.0` and the LÃ©vy exponent is heavier at
`levy_alpha=1.9`. Additional reproduction and swim cycles are used and an
optional local search phase can further refine the best solution after each
iteration.
