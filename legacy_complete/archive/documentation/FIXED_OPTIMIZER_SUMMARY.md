# PyTorch BFO Optimizer - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Loop in Swimming Behavior
**Problem**: The swim loop in `optimizer.py` had a logic error where it would continuously update fitness values and then check for improvement, creating an infinite loop.

**Solution**: Modified the swim loop to:
- Store old fitness values before re-evaluation
- Only update fitness for solutions that actually improved
- Properly update the improvement mask for the next iteration

### 2. Reproduction Step Bug
**Problem**: The reproduction step had a shape mismatch error when dealing with odd population sizes.

**Solution**: Fixed the indexing logic to properly handle both even and odd population sizes when replacing the worst half of the population with clones of the best half.

## Test Results

### Fixed BFO Performance
- **Simple Quadratic (3D)**: Reduced loss from 50 to 36.6 in 5 steps
- **Rosenbrock Function**: Reduced loss from 1664 to 23.9 in 20 iterations (98.6% improvement)
- **Time per step**: ~1 second on GPU (reasonable for population-based optimizer)

### Benchmark Comparison
```
Optimizer        Best Loss    Time/Step (ms)
-----------------------------------------
Adam             914.2047     13.4
BFO (fixed)      23.8691      1020.0
BFOv2            1434.1841    30.8
```

## Files Modified
1. `pytorch_bfo_optimizer/optimizer.py` - Fixed swim loop and reproduction step
2. Created test files to validate the fixes

## Status
✅ BFO optimizer is now working correctly
✅ No more infinite loops
✅ Handles odd population sizes properly
✅ Successfully optimizes test functions
❌ BFOv2 and HybridBFOv2 have separate issues (gradient handling) that need investigation
