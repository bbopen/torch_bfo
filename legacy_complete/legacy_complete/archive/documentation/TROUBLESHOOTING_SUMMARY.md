# PyTorch BFO Optimizer - Troubleshooting Summary

## Issue: Timeout During GPU Testing

### Root Cause
The timeouts were caused by:
1. **Default parameters too large for GPU**: population_size=50 with multiple nested loops
2. **Sequential population evaluation**: Each bacterium evaluated one at a time
3. **Multiple stuck processes**: Previous test runs were still running (100% CPU)

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Debug Logging System
Created `debug_utils.py` with:
- Environment-based logging levels (`BFO_DEBUG_LEVEL`)
- File and console logging
- Performance timing decorators
- Optimization progress tracking

#### 2. Verbose Mode
Added `verbose=True` parameter to optimizers:
```python
optimizer = BFO(params, verbose=True)
```

#### 3. Background Test Runner
Created `background_gpu_test.py` for:
- Running tests in background with `nohup`
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- System resource tracking
- Timeout protection

#### 4. Process Monitoring
Created `monitor_gpu_server.py` to:
- Check running Python processes
- Monitor GPU utilization
- Kill stuck processes
- Track test progress

## Performance Findings

With minimal settings (population_size=2, reduced iterations):
- **BFO step time**: ~0.235s
- **Closure evaluation**: ~1.5ms per call
- **Main bottleneck**: `_optimization_step` function (85% of time)

With default settings (population_size=50):
- Extremely slow due to O(population_size Ã— iterations) complexity
- Not suitable for GPU without significant optimization

## Recommended Usage

### For GPU
```python
optimizer = HybridBFO(
    model.parameters(),
    population_size=4,      # Small population
    chem_steps=2,           # Reduced iterations
    swim_length=2,          
    repro_steps=1,
    elim_steps=1,
    gradient_weight=0.7,    # Use gradients
    compile_mode=False,     # PyTorch 2.8.0.dev bug
    verbose=True            # Enable logging
)
```

### For Debugging
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export BFO_DEBUG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export BFO_LOG_FILE=/path/to/debug.log

# Run in background
nohup python your_script.py > output.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f /path/to/debug.log
```

### For Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor GPU server
python monitor_gpu_server.py --kill-stuck

# Check specific processes
ssh root@server "ps aux | grep python"
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Population-based optimizers are inherently slow on GPU** due to sequential evaluation
2. **Default parameters must be tuned** for efficient GPU execution
3. **Background execution with monitoring** is essential for long-running tests
4. **Debug logging** helps identify bottlenecks and stuck processes
5. **HybridBFO** performs best on GPU by leveraging gradient information

## Future Improvements

1. **Parallelize population evaluation** using batch operations
2. **Implement early stopping** based on convergence criteria
3. **Add GPU-specific optimizations** for population updates
4. **Create adaptive population sizing** based on problem complexity
5. **Benchmark against standard optimizers** with realistic workloads
