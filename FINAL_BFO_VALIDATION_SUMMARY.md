## Technical Implementation Details

### P0 Improvements (Priority 0)
```python
# Enhanced BFO Configuration
{
    'population_size': 50,
    'chemotaxis_steps': 10,
    'reproduction_steps': 5,
    'elimination_steps': 2,
    'step_size_max': 1.0,      # 10x increase
    'levy_alpha': 1.8,         # Heavier tails
    'enable_swarming': True,   # Population coordination
    'swim_length': 5           # Controlled exploration
}
```

### P1 Improvements (Priority 1)
```python
# ChaoticBFO Additional Features
{
    'enable_chaos': True,
    'chaos_strength': 0.5,
    'diversity_trigger_ratio': 0.5,
    'enable_crossover': True,
    'diversity_threshold_decay': 0.9
}
```

### Critical Algorithmic Components

#### 1. Diversity-Triggered Elimination
```python
if diversity < diversity_threshold:
    # Force high elimination to inject diversity
    num_replace = int(pop_size * self.diversity_trigger_ratio)
    # Generate new random positions in full domain
    new_positions = torch.rand((num_replace, param_dim)) * (domain_max - domain_min) + domain_min
    population[replace_idx] = new_positions
```

#### 2. Chaos Injection in Lévy Flight
```python
def _generate_chaos(self, size, device, dtype):
    x = torch.rand(size, device=device, dtype=dtype)
    for _ in range(10):  # Iterate to reach chaotic regime
        x = 4.0 * x * (1.0 - x)  # Logistic map
    return 2.0 * x - 1.0  # Scale to [-1, 1]
```

#### 3. GA Crossover in Reproduction
```python
# Uniform crossover
mask = torch.rand(param_dim, device=device) < 0.5
child = torch.where(mask, population[parent1_idx], population[parent2_idx])
# Add small mutation
mutation = torch.randn_like(child) * current_step_size * 0.1
population[worst_indices[i]] = child + mutation
```
